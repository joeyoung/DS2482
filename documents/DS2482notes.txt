Notes about DS2482 library - Feb 19/22

The schematic diagram I2CbridgeTo1-wire.pdf shows a test setup used to verify
the library operation. The low-voltage power supply, the power switching, and
the 5V to LV shifting are not necessary for testing the library functions, but
were part of an arduino simulation for testing the DS2482 library functions 
to be used in another datalogger project. 

The library has defined a begin( ) function which in present version is empty.
It is unnecessary but harmless to include begin( ) in setup for this version.

The DS2482.h file has a #define DEBUG commented out. If you uncomment that
define, there are a few Serial.print( ) functions showing status, timeout
counts, and so forth which can be helpful in isolating problems. Serial needs
to be available for this output to work.
