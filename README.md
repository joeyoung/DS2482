###DS2482 - arduino library of functions for I2C to one-wire bridge IC

The functions provided in this library originated with the description 
provided in the Dallas/Maxim application note 3684 "How to Use the 
DS2482 I2C 1-Wire Master".

At the time of posting (Feb, 2022) this library may be incomplete. It
has been tested with only the single-channel DS2482-100, arduino UNO,
and DS18B20 temperature sensors. In particular the functions for single-
bit one-wire operations have not been tested.
